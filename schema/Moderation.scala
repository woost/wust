  // - I don't want to see the request anymore, when I'm done thinking about it
  //   - After voting
  //   - It can reappear, when it is revised (like pull requests on github)
  //   - On merge conflicts (which need to be revised)
  // Reverting votes on change requests
  // - When do I want to revert a vote on a change request?
  //   - When I clicked the wrong button (undo)
  //   - When I see that another request is better and I want to apply that instead
  //   - When I rethink the request and change my mind
  // How long do change-actions stay in the vote-stream?
  //   - depending on how much more karma the mod had than the threshold of the post
  //   - If I voted, it hides for me
  //   - It doesn't appear for other when it was
  //     (depending on the quality of the post)
  //     - A good change:
  //     - A bad change:
  //     - Controversal?
  //       - Ability to comment/answer on changes?
